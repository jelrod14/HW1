# Split, Apply, Combine

Take dataset, omit NAs, group by sex and species, take the mean of teeth
number by sex and species

``` r

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'SEX'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.

# Plots

First a density plot to show distributions of teeth number, to see if
data is normal just in case we eventually want to do statistical tests.

``` r
ggplot(df, aes(x = TEETH_NUMBER, fill = factor(SPECIES), )) + geom_density(alpha = .5)
```

    ## Warning: Removed 26 rows containing non-finite values (stat_density).

Next, a point plot using the average of each species, colored by sex.

``` r
ggplot(df_sum, aes(x= SPECIES, y= mean_teeth, col = SEX))+geom_point()
```

By the analysis and visualization, we can see that the overall mean and
median of the number of teeth in snakes doesnâ€™t seem to vary much by sex
of the snake(except for potentially T.Mel no eat crayfish), but clearly
differs by species. This could be further proven by a statistic test
that compares means such as a t test for the male and female, and
perhaps and ANOVA for the species.
